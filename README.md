# Astar-Pathfinding-Visualisation

This application helps visualising the A* pathfinding algorithm.

# Requirements:

1) Python 3.x
2) Pygame

# How to operate:

1) Click on any node after the application starts to select it as the start point (which would then be marked in orange)

2) Similarly choose an end node (which would be marked in Turquoise)

3) Then add obstacle walls for the pathfinder by clicking on the nodes which are supposed to act as obstacles. A marked obstacle can be removed by right clicking

4) Press space to run the algorithm visualiser

# Visualisation:

1) The red marked nodes at any given time are the nodes which have been considered to be in the path by the algorithm

2) Green marked nodes at any given time, are the nodes which are next to be considered by the algorithm

3) Finally, after the algorithm completes, the shortest path is marked in purple
